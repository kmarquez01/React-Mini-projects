# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a TodoApp which was built using React Js coupled with Html and CSS. My goal with this app was to understand how to implement data from an API while also being able to update future state inputs. As a result, I know how to access user input data in real time and make applications run more smoothly and interactively.
